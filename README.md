# siteblock
Simple script which runs periodically to block productivity drains.

## Installation
`npm install`

## Running
`npm start`

## TODO:
1) Get this running as a cron job on mac/linux.
2) Extract blocked sites to a config file.
3) Create a script within the repo to auto set-up the cron job so this can be effortlessly ported to new machines.
